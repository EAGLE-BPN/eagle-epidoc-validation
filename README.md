EpiDoc customization to ensure EAGLE rules on EpiDoc files

This is a customization of the <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/p/epidoc/code/trunk/schema/tei-epidoc-full.xml">EpiDoc TEI ODD schema version 8.21</a> to check the validity of EpiDoc XML files created for the EAGLE project. The checking is made by several Schematron rules contained on a section marked as <b>EAGLE EpiDoc customizations</b>. As a result we have in this repository the ODD file <b>tei-epidoc-eagle.xml</b> containing the customization itself and the RelaxNG schema generated by using this file as input for the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/">ROMA tool</a>. The steps to generate a new customization are presented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Schema/">here</a>. Finally, the resulting RelaxNG schema <b>tei-epidoc-eagle.rng</b> can be use for checking that:
